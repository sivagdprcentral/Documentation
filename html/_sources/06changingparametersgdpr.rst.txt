How can I change different parameters of GDPR Central? 
*******************************************************

GDPR Central is an extremely versatile tool as you can configure most of the parameters easily. You can configure those data that are specific to individual companies as well as across organizations very easily, and by identifying how critical that data is through Administration and Configuration sections. 

Some of the data that can be configured under administration (across all the related organizations within GDPR Central) are personal data, data security assessments, data subject categories, recipients, available locations, security measures, Dpa checklist, legal basis, processors, assets, and retention times. Some of the data that can be configured under configuration (specific to a customer) data subject categories, retention times and personal data.

More detailed information on each of the configurable parameters are covered in the GDPR Configuration Administrator’s and Super Administrator’s Guides.
