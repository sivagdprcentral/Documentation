How do I request for approval or approve a Processing Activity?
***************************************************************
As Processing Activity is an important record mandated by GDPR regulations, it is important that any Processing Activity that is created or changed also goes through a formal approval process. 

.. note::
   If a change is made to a previously approved activity it will lose its approved status and must be reverified and reapproved before it can be considered the latest approved version.
