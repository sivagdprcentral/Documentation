Understanding Action Plans
==========================

Action Plans allow you to ensure all actions (i.e. tasks to be performed within GDPR Central) are generated and listed in a central place, so they are not missed. This is a key functionality of the tool which allows you to be in control of all key tasks to be performed as well as ensure nothing is missed.
