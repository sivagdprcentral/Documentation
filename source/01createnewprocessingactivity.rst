Understanding Processing Activity:
==================================
A Processing Activity is a written documentation and overview of procedures by which personal data are processed. It is mandated by GDPR regulations that a Record of Processing Activities be maintained by any organization. This must include significant information about data processing and mainly the purpose of the processing and the data recipients. 

A Processing Activity can be a part of a registry, which is a collection of processing activities grouped in the business. Registry allows you to organize processing activities.
