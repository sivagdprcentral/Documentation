To create links between different reStructuredText (.rst) files you can use the inline markup provided by sphinx. See the documentation under the heading Cross-referencing documents

on top of the file you define its label

.. _my-reference-label:
then you can link to it from other documents using

:ref:`my-reference-label`.
